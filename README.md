# Bicep Authoring Devcontainer

This is a simple devcontainer which can be used with CodeSpaces or VSCode Remote to get all the tooling needed to start authoring bicep. 

## Quick Start: VSCode Remote
1. Clone the repository.
1. Configure the development environment by installing VSCode and the "Dev Containers" extension or "Remote Development" extension pack. [Quick start docs here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers-tutorial).
1. Open the repository in VSCode
1. [`CTRL+SHIFT+P` then type `Reopen in container`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_getting-started) to open the devcontainer in VSCode.
1. [Open a terminal in VSCode with `CTRL+SHIFT+P` -> `Terminal: Create new integrated terminal`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_opening-a-terminal). We'll use this to run Bicep commands.
1. [Run `az login`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli) from the VSCode terminal to connect to your Azure account.
1. Run the following to create a resource group and deploy your Bicep file to it.
    ```sh
    az group create -n my-rg -l eastus
    az deployment group create -f ./main.bicep -g my-rg
    ```
1. Open [main.bicep](./main.bicep) in to modify the resources you want to deploy, and re-run the `az deployment group` command to re-deploy the resources.

## Quick Start: Codespaces
1. Open this repository in [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).
1. Open a terminal in VSCode with `CTRL+J`. We'll use this to run Bicep commands.
1. [Run `az login`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli) from the VSCode terminal to connect to your Azure account.
1. Run the following to create a resource group and deploy your Bicep file to it.
    ```sh
    az group create -n my-rg -l eastus
    az deployment group create -f ./main.bicep -g my-rg
    ```
1. Open [main.bicep](./main.bicep) in your Codespaces window to modify the resources you want to deploy, and re-run the `az deployment group` command to re-deploy the resources.

## Next Steps

Review [the Bicep documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/overview) to build out more advanced scenarios.
